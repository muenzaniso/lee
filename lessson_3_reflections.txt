Describe the difference between forks,clones, and branches. When would use one instead of another?

clone: is when you copy a repository from the url onto your local machine 
fork:copying direct from cloud to a cloud without first coping on your local machine
branch:creating a new version but still the old version being usable and also the old version might still be the main version
forking usually used when you dont want have the repository on your local server while cloning when you want it on your machine especially when you need to edit
then branches usually done in trying to experiment a new feature
